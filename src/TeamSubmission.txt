csci142 Puzzle Solver, Project Part 2:  Water & Clock

Names: Robin Li Lakshay Khatter

Robin Li - implemented changes to the puzzle inferface to incorporate
generics. Made revisions to the solver and clock puzzle. Made the constructor
for the water puzzle and the isGoal and getStart. Created another data
structure for Jug for the water puzzle. Made revisions to the
water.java file after Lakshay completed it. 

Lakshay - made the getNeighbors() method and wrote the main method to
show the correct format. Did testing to make sure the solver works 
with both clock and water.
